                Most would like to be a little wealthier. Some want to be the wealthiest. 2781 people in the World have
                reached the financial summit: The Billionaires.
            </p>
            <p>
                They each have a private wealth of at least 1,000,000,000: 9 zeros. This minute portion of the
                population has captured an outsized amount of total global wealth.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-2">
            <p>Here's what that looks like. This represents who owns all of the World's wealth.</p>
            <p>The poorest half of the World share 2% of all the wealth in the World. The top 10% have captured 78%.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-3">
            <p>And then there's the Billionaires. Less than 3000 individuals have three times as much wealth as half of
                the World's population.</p>
            <p class="para-text">The gap between the poorest and the richest has been growing bigger</p>
            <p class="para-text">and bigger</p>
            <p class="para-text">for the last four decades.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-4">
            <div id="dataviz_one"></div>
            <p>In the 1980s, Thatcher and Reagan championed a radical new idea: Individuals should be free to pursue
                wealth and governments should get out of the way. Their ideas inspired the World. Countries vied to
                attract big businesses and the wealthy by dismantling regulations and enabling wealth to flow across
                borders.</p>
            <p>Businesses thrived. But another transformation was happening too: The World’s wealth was concentrating in
                the hands of the few. In richer countries, we have reached an extreme: the totality of wealth is now in
                private hands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-5">
            <div id="static-viz-public-wealth"></div>
            <p>In the UK, Public Wealth has dropped from 102% of national income in 1980 to -106% in 2020. One of the
                fundamental mechanisms for addressing this ever-widening gap between rich and poor is the progressive
                tax system, where individuals contribute in accordance with their earnings. For a long time, the amount
                Billionaires pay in taxes have been shrouded in mystery. Until now. Recent studies have gathered just
                enough data to start painting a clearer picture. The findings reveal a stark truth:</p>
            <p>Billionaires are paying significantly less tax than anyone else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-6">
            <div id="static-viz-less-tax"></div>
            <p>This represents how much each income group pays in taxes. This group are the majority: The bottom 90% of
                earners. When you average out across the three countries studied, they’re all paying around the same
                percentage, 36%. This group are the Billionaires. This time they’re the smallest dot: Because they’re
                paying the least tax. As a percentage of income, it works out to be about 25%. But that figure is hiding
                a crucial detail: Billionaires tend to keep their tax-vulnerable incomes low. Instead, the majority of
                their wealth sits in things like dividends or assets and they borrow against those assets. Take Elon
                Musk for example, who earned no salary in 2023 and borrowed the $13 billion to buy Twitter from interest
                free loans off the back of his wealth portfolio.</p>
            <p>If you take their tax rate as a percentage of their wealth, it’s close to 0%.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-7">
            <p>In the dance of wealth and taxation, the savvy wealthy individual has long mastered the art of
                sidestepping high tax rates, often without straying into the realm of outright evasion.</p>
            <p>Since the 80s, countries have competed to attract Billionaires and multinational companies by effectively
                facilitating this tax dodge: As a result, the average corporation income tax rate fell by half in the
                space of three decades. The rich have grown exponentially richer, faster than anyone else, leading us to
                crash land where we are now: a Topsy Turvy World where the wealthiest pay the lowest effective tax rate.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-8">
            <p>The EU Tax Observatory, a Research Institute run out of the Paris School of Economics, argue that this
                reality is not inevitable. They propose a bold solution: The total global tax paid by a billionaire
                should not fall below 2% of their wealth. Put simply: If Bloombery or Forbes can figure out how much
                someone is worth, so should the taxman.</p>
            <p>Global cooperation may seem like a pipe dream. After all, wealthy individuals offer huge benefits to
                countries who make them feel welcome. But recent history can inspire: In 2021, 140 countries agreed on a
                minimum 15% tax rate for multinational corporations. The rule has holes and snags, but it’s progress.
                Another leap forward has been the automatic exchange of banking information since 2017, which led to a
                two-thirds reduction in offshore tax evasion within a decade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-9">
            <p>The possibility of international cooperation is real, but it’s also possible for countries to make
                significant progress alone: Only Thirty counties host more than 10 billionaires. Any of those countries
                could decide to enforce a minimum tax on wealthy long-term residents, preventing them from amassing
                fortunes domestically only to relocate their wealth abroad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snap-slide" id="slide-10">
            <p class="para-text">So let's get back to our Dots.</p>
            <p class="para-text">It's hard to comprehend how much wealth the Billionaires collectively have. So let's
                imagine this dot represents a Billion dollars. It's a Billion dollar dot.</p>

            <p>Right here. It is hiding in plain sight.</p>
            <p>If a 2% minimum tax on billionaires is introduced, we would raise $214 billion from less than 3000
                individuals. Hover over the dot to find out which part of the World could claim that billion dollars.
